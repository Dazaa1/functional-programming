# Exercise 2 notes:
- Anonymous functions have no name and in python they are called ``lamba`` functions, here is an example

```python
    add_one = lambda x: x + 1
    print(add_one(2))
    # 3
```
- ``lamba`` function here takes x as an argument in this case it is ``2`` and return ``x + 1``, all we do is store it on a different variable and print the result. ``x + 1`` is returned automatically no need for a ``return`` statement.
