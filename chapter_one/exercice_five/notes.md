# Exercise 5 notes:
- functional programming is about returning to the most basic aspects of programming and looking at them in a new way.

## Statements:
- Statements are actions to be carried out.
- set ==n== to ==7==
- Define a function named ==greet==.

```python
    n = 7  # Variable assignment statement

    def greet(name):  # Function definition statement
        return f"Hello, {name}!"

    if x > 10:  # `if` statement
        print(greet("Alice"))

    for i in range(n):  # `for` loop statement
        print(i)
```

## Expressions:
```python
    result = 2 + 2  # Arithmetic expression
    length = len("hello")  # Function call expression
    total_cost = len(items) * cost  # Multiple expressions combined into one
```

- Functional programming encourages the use of expressions.
